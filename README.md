## Development

### Requirements

#### Ubuntu

In Ubuntu the development files of `libudev` are necessary:

```
sudo apt-get install libudev-dev libusb-1.0-0-dev
```

#### Node 16

To download, head over to [here](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download Node 16.

Due to a bug in the V8 JavaScript Engine that effects NodeJS version 16.10.x and above we recommend installing version 16.9.x

If you already have npm installed, you can run

```
npm install -g n
sudo n 16.9
```

#### pnpm

Install the pnpm dependency manager

```
npm install -g pnpm
```
